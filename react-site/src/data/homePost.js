    I'm building this site to record and showcase the projects I've been working on! 

    I'm a senior studying electrical engineering at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah with a minor in math. I'm originally from the Bay Area and love cooking, taking things apart, and upgrading my EDC.

    I'm getting into home networking, so expect updates on that as I keep learning more about building my own NAS, hosting a media server, and optimising home automations.
