This post demonstrates a wide layout (no sidebar) and how to include mathematical equations using MathJax.

## Mathematical Equations

When \\(a \\ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are:

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

### Complex Mathematical Concepts

The Euler's identity is often considered the most beautiful equation in mathematics:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

## Wide Layout Benefits

The wide layout (enabled by `classes: wide` in the front matter) is perfect for:
- Long equations
- Wide tables
- Large images
- Code blocks that might be too constrained in the normal layout

## Sample Table

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | Header 4 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
| Cell 5   | Cell 6   | Cell 7   | Cell 8   |
| Cell 9   | Cell 10  | Cell 11  | Cell 12  |

## Custom HTML Elements

<div class="full">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400" alt="Wide image">
</div>
